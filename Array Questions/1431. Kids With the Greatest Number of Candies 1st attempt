/*
Intuition:
  The goal of this problem is to determine if giving the extra candies to each kid would make them have
the greatest number of candies among all the kids. An example of such is you are given an array with the
amount of candy each kid has [2,3,5,1,3] with extra candies 3. It should return [true, true, true, false, true].
To do this problem we can have a loop to get the kid with the largest amount of candy, then use another loop 
to add the extra candy to each kid to see if its  equal or greater then the previous kid with the largest amount of candy.

Approach:
    1. Use a loop to find the maximum number of candies among all the kids. 
    2. Iterate through the array, check if giving each kid would result them having more candies than or equal to the maximum number of candies
    3. Store the results indicating whether each kid can have the greatest number of candies after receiving extra candies

Complexity:
  Time Complexity: 
    O(n) where n is the size of candy
  Space Complexity:
    O(n) where n is the size of the candy
