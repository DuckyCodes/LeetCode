Intuition

The function is designed to find the number in the list `nums` that has the smallest **sum of digits**. Here's the process:

1. For each number in `nums`, the function calculates the sum of its digits.
2. It keeps track of the smallest sum of digits encountered so far.
3. For each number, the sum of its digits is calculated by repeatedly taking the remainder when divided by 10 (to get the last digit) and adding it to a sum accumulator (`sumT`), then dividing the number by 10 to remove the last digit.
4. Once the sum of digits is computed for a number, the function compares it to the current minimum (`minN`) and updates the minimum if necessary.
5. At the end, the function returns the number with the smallest sum of digits.

Time Complexity
Let n be the number of elements in nums.
Let d be the maximum number of digits in any element of nums.
For each number in nums, the time complexity for calculating the sum of digits is proportional to the number of digits in the number. So, for all n numbers:

Time complexity:
The time complexity is 
O(nâ‹…d), where:
n is the number of elements in nums.
d is the average number of digits in the numbers.
This is because each number requires time proportional to its digit length to sum the digits.

Space Complexity

The space complexity is 
O(1), as the algorithm uses only a few integer variables (sumT, minN) to track intermediate sums and comparisons,
and does not require any additional data structures that grow with the input size. Thus, the space complexity is constant regardless of the size of the input list.
